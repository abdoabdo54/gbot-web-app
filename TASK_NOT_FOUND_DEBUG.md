# 🔍 Task Not Found Debug Enhancement Summary

## ❌ **Problem Identified**

The domain change process was still failing with:
```
Domain Change Progress
0%
Task not found
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was likely caused by **Aggressive Task Cleanup**:

### **The Problem:**
- Tasks were being cleaned up too aggressively by `cleanup_old_progress()`
- The cleanup function was called on every progress request
- Tasks might be getting removed before the frontend could poll them
- No visibility into what was happening with the progress tracker

### **Technical Details:**
```python
# This was too aggressive:
if age_minutes > 120 or (progress['status'] in ['completed', 'error'] and age_minutes > 10):
    expired_tasks.append(task_id)  # ❌ Removing tasks too quickly
```

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Debugging:**
```python
# Added comprehensive logging to track task lifecycle
logging.info(f"Progress requested for task: {task_id}")
logging.info(f"Available tasks before cleanup: {available_tasks}")
logging.info(f"Available tasks after cleanup: {available_tasks_after}")
logging.info(f"Task {task_id} successfully created and stored in progress tracker")
```

### **2. Less Aggressive Cleanup:**
```python
# Before: 2 hours for active tasks, 10 minutes for completed tasks
if age_minutes > 120 or (progress['status'] in ['completed', 'error'] and age_minutes > 10):

# After: 24 hours for active tasks, 1 hour for completed tasks  
if age_minutes > 1440 or (progress['status'] in ['completed', 'error'] and age_minutes > 60):
```

### **3. Task Creation Verification:**
```python
# Verify task was created properly
with progress_lock:
    if task_id in progress_tracker:
        logging.info(f"Task {task_id} successfully created and stored in progress tracker")
    else:
        logging.error(f"Task {task_id} was NOT stored in progress tracker!")
```

### **4. Debug Endpoints:**
```python
# Added debug endpoints to inspect progress tracker
@app.route('/api/debug-progress', methods=['GET'])
@app.route('/api/debug-progress-raw', methods=['GET'])
```

## 🚀 **Key Improvements**

### **Enhanced Logging:**
- ✅ **Task Creation:** Logs when tasks are created and stored
- ✅ **Task Retrieval:** Logs when tasks are requested
- ✅ **Cleanup Process:** Logs what tasks are available before/after cleanup
- ✅ **Error Tracking:** Comprehensive error logging throughout the process

### **Less Aggressive Cleanup:**
- ✅ **Longer Retention:** Tasks kept for 24 hours instead of 2 hours
- ✅ **Completed Tasks:** Completed tasks kept for 1 hour instead of 10 minutes
- ✅ **Better Logging:** Detailed logging of cleanup decisions
- ✅ **Memory Safety:** Still prevents memory leaks but less aggressive

### **Debug Visibility:**
- ✅ **Real-time Inspection:** Debug endpoints to check progress tracker state
- ✅ **Task Lifecycle:** Complete visibility into task creation, updates, and cleanup
- ✅ **Error Diagnosis:** Easy identification of where tasks are being lost
- ✅ **Production Debugging:** Debug endpoints available for troubleshooting

## 🧪 **Technical Implementation**

### **Before (Problematic):**
```python
# Too aggressive cleanup
if age_minutes > 120 or (progress['status'] in ['completed', 'error'] and age_minutes > 10):
    expired_tasks.append(task_id)

# No debugging visibility
progress = get_progress(task_id)  # No logging of what's happening
```

### **After (Enhanced):**
```python
# Much less aggressive cleanup
if age_minutes > 1440 or (progress['status'] in ['completed', 'error'] and age_minutes > 60):
    expired_tasks.append(task_id)
    logging.info(f"Marking task {task_id} for cleanup: age={age_minutes:.1f}min, status={progress['status']}")

# Comprehensive debugging
logging.info(f"Available tasks before cleanup: {available_tasks}")
cleanup_old_progress()
logging.info(f"Available tasks after cleanup: {available_tasks_after}")
progress = get_progress(task_id)
logging.info(f"Progress for task {task_id}: {progress['status']} - {progress['message']}")
```

### **Debug Endpoints:**
```python
# Check progress tracker state
GET /api/debug-progress
# Returns: active_tasks, task_count, tasks, timestamp

# Raw progress tracker access
GET /api/debug-progress-raw  
# Returns: progress_tracker, timestamp
```

## 🎯 **Benefits**

### **For Users:**
- ✅ **Reliable Progress:** Tasks won't be cleaned up too quickly
- ✅ **Better Feedback:** More detailed progress information
- ✅ **Stable Operation:** Less likely to lose track of running tasks
- ✅ **Error Recovery:** Better error handling and reporting

### **For Administrators:**
- ✅ **Debug Visibility:** Easy to diagnose progress tracking issues
- ✅ **Logging:** Comprehensive logs for troubleshooting
- ✅ **Monitoring:** Debug endpoints for real-time monitoring
- ✅ **Maintenance:** Less aggressive cleanup reduces maintenance issues

## 🔧 **Debugging Workflow**

### **When "Task not found" occurs:**

1. **Check Debug Endpoint:**
   ```
   GET /api/debug-progress
   ```
   - See what tasks are currently in the tracker
   - Check if the task was ever created

2. **Check Logs:**
   - Look for "Task {task_id} successfully created and stored"
   - Look for "Available tasks before/after cleanup"
   - Look for "Marking task {task_id} for cleanup"

3. **Identify Issue:**
   - Task not created: Check async endpoint logs
   - Task cleaned up: Check cleanup logs and timing
   - Task exists but not found: Check get_progress function

### **Debug Endpoints Usage:**
```bash
# Check current progress tracker state
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/debug-progress" \
  -H "Cookie: session=your_session_cookie"

# Check raw progress tracker (no processing)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/debug-progress-raw" \
  -H "Cookie: session=your_session_cookie"
```
