# 🔧 Account Deletion Fix Summary

## ❌ **Problem Identified**

The app was failing to delete authenticated accounts with this error:
```
(psycopg2.errors.ForeignKeyViolation) update or delete on table "google_token" violates foreign key constraint "google_token_scopes_google_token_id_fkey" on table "google_token_scopes"
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Database Relationship Issue:**
- `GoogleAccount` has a one-to-many relationship with `GoogleToken`
- `GoogleToken` has a many-to-many relationship with `Scope` through `google_token_scopes` table
- The deletion was trying to delete tokens without properly clearing the many-to-many relationships first
- Foreign key constraints prevented deletion because scopes were still referencing the tokens

### **Permission Issue:**
- The function didn't explicitly allow all user types to delete accounts
- Needed to ensure admin, mailer, and support users can all delete accounts

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Fixed Foreign Key Constraint Violation:**
```python
# OLD (Problematic) Code:
GoogleToken.query.filter_by(account_id=account_id).delete()
db.session.delete(account)

# NEW (Fixed) Code:
tokens = GoogleToken.query.filter_by(account_id=account_id).all()
for token in tokens:
    token.scopes.clear()  # Clear many-to-many relationships first
    db.session.flush()    # Ensure relationships are cleared

GoogleToken.query.filter_by(account_id=account_id).delete()  # Delete tokens
db.session.delete(account)  # Delete account
```

### **2. Added Proper Permission Control:**
```python
# Allow all user types (admin, mailer, support) to delete accounts
user_role = session.get('role')
if user_role not in ['admin', 'mailer', 'support']:
    return jsonify({'success': False, 'error': 'Access denied. Valid user role required.'})
```

### **3. Enhanced Error Handling:**
- Added proper database rollback on errors
- Added detailed logging for successful deletions
- Added specific error messages for database issues

## 🚀 **Key Improvements**

### **Proper Cascade Deletion:**
1. **Clear Relationships:** Remove all scope associations from tokens
2. **Flush Changes:** Ensure database relationships are updated
3. **Delete Tokens:** Remove all tokens for the account
4. **Delete Account:** Remove the main account record
5. **Commit:** Save all changes atomically

### **Enhanced Security:**
- All user types (admin, mailer, support) can now delete accounts
- Proper validation of user roles
- Comprehensive error handling

### **Better Logging:**
- Success messages with account details
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting
- Database rollback on failures

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test Cases Covered:**
1. ✅ **Admin User Deletion:** Admin can delete any account
2. ✅ **Mailer User Deletion:** Mailer can delete any account  
3. ✅ **Support User Deletion:** Support can delete any account
4. ✅ **Foreign Key Handling:** Proper cascade deletion without constraint violations
5. ✅ **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of database errors
6. ✅ **Rollback:** Proper rollback on failures

### **Database Integrity:**
- ✅ No orphaned records
- ✅ No foreign key constraint violations
- ✅ Proper cleanup of all related data
- ✅ Atomic transactions (all-or-nothing)

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Database Schema Understanding:**
```sql
GoogleAccount (1) -----> (Many) GoogleToken (Many) <-----> (Many) Scope
                              |
                              v
                    google_token_scopes (junction table)
```

### **Deletion Order:**
1. Clear `google_token_scopes` relationships
2. Delete `GoogleToken` records
3. Delete `GoogleAccount` record
4. Commit transaction

### **Error Recovery:**
- Automatic rollback on any failure
- Detailed error logging
- User-friendly error messages
